## Mobile Games A/B Testing - Cookie Cats

**Project description:** Project summary: Cookie Cats, a popular mobile puzzle game, imposes a ‘gate’, where players are forced to wait a significant amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress, as players continue to progress the game. The A/B test was conducted to examine whether the ‘gate’ is better to be deployed in Level. 30 or Level. 40. 

### 1. Problem Statement

Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three"--style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats.

As players advance in the game, they'll encounter occasional gates that require a significant amount of waiting timeor making in-app purchases to proceed, boosting purchases and providing players a necessary pause, potentially enhancing their enjoyment and prolonging engagement. Initially set at level 30, we'll analyze an AB-test in Cookie Cats, shifting the first gate to level 40, specifically assessing its effect on player retention. In particular, the impact on player retention is focused.

### 3. Summary Statistics and Visualization

After exploring the data, there were no missing values but some outliers in the dataset. 
The retention rates after 1 day are 44.8% (Gate 30) vs 44.2% (Gate 40) while 7-day retention rates are 19% (Gate 30) vs 18.2% for (Gate 40). Putting the date at lv.30 has slightly higher retention on the both day(s).

By plotting the total rounds of games that the players in both groups had gone through, it was found that fewer players were retained in the game as the game rounds progressed. also, 3994 players never played the game after installing the game(!).
