### Movile Game A/B Testing
Cookie Cats, a popular mobile puzzle game, imposes a ‘gate’, where players are forced to wait a significant amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress, as players continue to progress the game. The A/B test was conducted to examine whether the ‘gate’ is better to be deployed in Level. 30 or Level. 40.

In this project, I designed and conducted Hypothesis Testing by understanding the business problem, forming a hypothesis, and evaluating the statistical significance for the Mobile Game user retention.
