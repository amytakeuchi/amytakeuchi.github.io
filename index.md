### Movile Game A/B Testing
Cookie Cats, a popular mobile puzzle game, imposes a ‘gate’, where players are forced to wait a significant amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress, as players continue to progress the game. The A/B test was conducted to examine whether the ‘gate’ is better to be deployed in Level. 30 or Level. 40.

In this project, I designed and conducted Hypothesis Testing by understanding the business problem, forming a hypothesis, and evaluating the statistical significance for the Mobile Game user retention.

### Marketplace Listing Price Prediction
Mercari, a Japanese online marketplace, is confronting a challenge to determine the product listing price based on different product categories, brand names, and specs and make suggestions about the optimal selling price to the sellers.

In this project, I (1) created 20+ Visualizations to identify the patterns and trends for the pricing of listed products, (2) built a listing price recommendation tool based on listing features and different Linear Regression models, using Python ScikitLearn and Pandas, (3) conducted Topic Modeling to identify the top 10 topics that appear in the descriptions of listings; performed extensive text data cleaning.
